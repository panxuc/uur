# Platform support and usage

`uur` selects Linux integrations by observable capability. Distribution and
desktop names below help users install the right dependencies. `uur doctor`
reports the active login session.

The current release target is Linux x86_64. Wine must be able to run the
official 64-bit UU Remote client.

## Runtime dependency axes

| Capability | Preferred route | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wayland video | ScreenCast portal + PipeWire | Portal virtual/window sources |
| X11 video | Wine X11 capture | ScreenCast portal when explicitly selected |
| Wayland input | RemoteDesktop portal | uinput; XTest for XWayland windows |
| X11 input | XTest | uinput |
| Audio | PulseAudio protocol | pipewire-pulse; ALSA |
| Wine windows | X11/XWayland | Wine Wayland driver |
| Application launch | `gio launch` | `gtk-launch` |
| Suspend inhibition | Inhibit portal | Session continues without an inhibitor |
| WOL persistence | NetworkManager + ethtool | ethtool runtime state |
| Hardware inventory | DRM + VA-API/Vulkan Video | NVENC/NVDEC; software codec |

Common portal packages include `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome`,
`xdg-desktop-portal-kde`, `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland`,
`xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`, `xdg-desktop-portal-lxqt`,
`xdg-desktop-portal-xapp`, `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`, and compositor-specific
implementations. The active interfaces determine the selected path.

## Install by distribution family

### Arch package family

This includes Arch Linux and distributions that consume Arch packages or the
AUR, such as EndeavourOS, CachyOS, Manjaro, Garuda Linux, Artix Linux, and
Arch-based development systems. Init-system choice does not affect uur; it
does not require a persistent systemd service.

From AUR:

```bash
paru -S uur
```

From a downloaded Arch package:

```bash
sudo pacman -U ./uur-0.1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

Install the portal backend supplied or recommended by the selected desktop.
On a capture-only Wayland portal, ensure the active user can open
`/dev/uinput`; the package installs a udev rule and a module-load entry.

### Debian package family

The deb artifact is intended for current Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS,
Zorin OS, elementary OS, KDE neon, TUXEDO OS, Kali Linux, MX Linux, and other
compatible derivatives:

```bash
sudo apt install ./uur_0.1.0_amd64.deb
```

The package manager resolves Wine, PipeWire, and the portal frontend. Install
the session's portal backend separately when the distribution does not pull it
in with the desktop environment.

### RPM package family

The rpm artifact targets current Fedora and distributions with compatible RPM
dependency names. Install it with the native frontend:

```bash
# Fedora and compatible systems
sudo dnf install ./uur-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm

# openSUSE family
sudo zypper install ./uur-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

RHEL, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Oracle Linux, Nobara, Ultramarine,
openSUSE Tumbleweed, and openSUSE Leap can use the RPM when its dependency names
resolve, with the portable or source build covering other package layouts.

### Other conventional distributions

Gentoo, Funtoo, Void Linux, Slackware, Solus, Clear Linux, Mageia, OpenMandriva,
PCLinuxOS, and similar mutable/FHS systems can use the portable archive when
they provide compatible glibc, Wine, PipeWire, and portal libraries:

```bash
sudo tar --zstd -C / -xf ./uur-0.1.0-linux-x86_64.tar.zst
```

Alternatively, build and install for one user:

```bash
cargo build --release --locked
./hook/build.sh
./capture/build.sh
./scripts/install-user.sh
```

The source build needs Rust, a native C compiler, PipeWire development files,
`pkg-config`, and the MinGW-w64 x86_64 compiler and binutils. Package names are
distribution-specific; uur does not invoke a package manager itself.

### Immutable, declarative, and musl systems

NixOS uses the repository flake and NixOS module described in [Nix and
NixOS](nix.md). The module installs the package, udev integration, and `uinput`
kernel module declaratively.

Alpine edge uses `packaging/alpine/APKBUILD` or the included musl container
build. GNU Guix can package the same staged layout. Flatpak and Snap require
host input, Wine, and portal permissions that are best expressed as dedicated
manifests.

## Select the desktop integration path

### X11 session

Requirements: `DISPLAY`, Wine's X11 driver, and the XTest extension.

This path applies to full desktops and standalone window managers alike. Common
examples include Xorg sessions of GNOME, Plasma, Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, LXQt,
LXDE, Budgie, Deepin, Pantheon, Trinity, and UKUI, plus i3, bspwm, awesome,
Openbox, Fluxbox, IceWM, dwm, qtile, herbstluftwm, spectrwm, and FVWM.

Wine captures the X11 desktop directly and uur injects input with XTest. A
ScreenCast portal is not required for this path.

### Wayland session with ScreenCast and RemoteDesktop portals

Requirements: a working session D-Bus, PipeWire, the xdg-desktop-portal
frontend, and a backend exposing both `ScreenCast` and `RemoteDesktop`.

Where those interfaces are available, uur creates one combined session for
capture and input. This is the preferred unprivileged route. Examples can
include current GNOME Shell, KDE Plasma, niri with its recommended portal
configuration, COSMIC, and other sessions whose selected portal backend
advertises both interfaces. Interface availability—not the desktop name—makes
the final decision.

### Wayland session with a capture-only portal

Requirements: ScreenCast/PipeWire plus writable `/dev/uinput` for full desktop
input. XTest remains only a partial fallback for XWayland surfaces.

This route commonly applies to compositors using Hyprland or wlroots-oriented
portal backends, including Hyprland, Sway, Wayfire, river, labwc, dwl, Waybox,
and other wlroots-based sessions. It may also apply to a desktop whose portal
installation is incomplete or whose selected backend omits RemoteDesktop.

Install the compositor's ScreenCast portal and enable uinput access. A
`portals.conf` selects the backend when several are installed.

### Wine window backend

The UU user interface still needs a Wine display driver:

- Existing X11 and most Wayland desktop sessions normally use Wine through
  X11 or XWayland.
- Compositors without built-in XWayland can use an external XWayland manager;
  niri, for example, integrates xwayland-satellite in current releases.
- Wine builds with a usable native Wayland driver may run without XWayland,
  but that combination must still pass UU WebView2 and window-management tests.

This choice is independent from desktop capture. A client window can use
XWayland while the controlled desktop is captured through the Wayland portal.

### Audio servers

Wine's PulseAudio driver is selected for both a native PulseAudio daemon and
the `pipewire-pulse` compatibility server. A native PipeWire session without
PulseAudio compatibility uses Wine's ALSA driver. `uur doctor` prints the live
choice; this is independent from PipeWire's Wayland video role.

### Displays and virtual sources

```bash
uur display status
uur display source monitor
uur display source window
uur display source virtual
```

The command clears the old restore token so the next Portal session can create
or select the requested source. X11 exposes its XRandR topology to Wine.
Wayland currently carries one selected stream; independent multi-stream
switching is the next display-topology adapter.

## First run and normal use

After installing any package format:

```bash
uur doctor
uur setup --accept-eula
uur run
```

Optional host integration is managed explicitly:

```bash
uur autostart enable
uur autostart status
uur wol status
sudo uur wol enable --interface enp3s0
```

The WOL command configures the real Linux adapter; it requires `ethtool`, and
persists the setting through an active NetworkManager wired profile when one
exists. The adapter name above is only an example—omit it for automatic
physical-interface selection.

The package installs `uur.desktop` as the canonical application-menu entry.
During setup, an existing Wine-generated Linux desktop entry for the official
client is converted into a hidden compatibility alias whose command is also
`uur run`. This keeps already pinned Dock, panel, or launcher favorites working
without showing a duplicate application in new searches.

The `.lnk` file inside the Wine prefix remains available for diagnosis. Normal
desktop integration launches `uur.desktop` or `uur run` so all helpers share
the same lifetime.

The first Wayland run may show a portal chooser. Select the monitor to expose
to remote controllers. A successful persistent portal grant is reused where
the backend supports restore tokens.

UU Quick Launch is populated from visible XDG desktop entries every time
`uur run` starts. This includes conventional packages and any containerized or
portable application that publishes a valid `.desktop` entry. Application
activation uses the desktop entry itself, so uur does not maintain a command
translation table.

Stop only the managed session and its Wine prefix with:

```bash
uur stop
```

Useful input-backend overrides for diagnosis are:

```bash
UUR_INPUT_BACKEND=portal uur run
UUR_INPUT_BACKEND=uinput uur run
UUR_INPUT_BACKEND=xtest uur run
```

An override is a diagnostic tool, not a desktop-specific configuration. The
default `auto` mode should be used after troubleshooting.

## Reading `uur doctor`

- `portal ScreenCast`: required to capture a Wayland desktop.
- `portal RemoteDesktop`: preferred unprivileged Wayland input route.
- `uinput (/dev/uinput)`: full-desktop fallback when RemoteDesktop is absent.
- `DISPLAY`: required for Wine/X11 or Wine/XWayland and for XTest fallback.
- `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`: identifies the active Wayland session.
- `PipeWire`: required for the Wayland frame transport.

If both Wayland input routes are unavailable, XTest controls XWayland windows.

## Session model

Portal sessions operate in the logged-in desktop seat. Display-manager access
uses a display-manager remote session, while headless operation uses a portal
virtual source or a provisioned virtual display. `uur doctor` reports the
active backend capabilities.
